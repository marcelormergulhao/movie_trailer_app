Movie Trailer Website Project

What is it?
Python code to generate a web page and open it on a browser.
The page displays the title and the poster of each movie and if you click the
movie poster the trailer pops up.

Where do I get it?
The main repository of this code is https://github.com/marph13/movie_trailer_app.
Feel free to clone or fork it!
Example:
	git clone https://github.com/marph13/movie_trailer_app.git

How do I run it?
Running the project is simples, just clone the repo or unzip the project file
and run the "entertainment_center.py" file with Python 3 interpreter.
The program expects a relative path "files/movie.json" to load all the info
about the movies, and suggests an error if the file is not there.
Example:
	python3 entertainment_center.py

Resources used on the project:
All the movie trailers are links from Youtube (www.youtube.com), all the posters
come from IMP Awards (www.impawards.com) and the "fresh_tomatoes.py" engine is
heavily based on the code provided by Udacity in
(https://github.com/adarsh0806/ud036_StarterCode/blob/master/fresh_tomatoes.py).
